### **Ford Vehicle Price Predictor** üöó
> Predicting the prices of Ford vehicles with precision and accuracy, making informed purchasing decisions easier for customers üìä

üìñ Description
-------------
The Ford Vehicle Price Predictor is a Python-based project that utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the prices of Ford vehicles. This project aims to provide an accurate and reliable tool for customers to determine the prices of Ford vehicles based on various factors such as model, year, mileage, and condition. The project uses a pre-trained machine learning model, which is loaded using the `joblib` library, to make predictions on new, unseen data.

The project is built using the Streamlit framework, which allows for the creation of interactive web applications with ease. The application takes in user input for various features of the vehicle, such as model, year, mileage, and condition, and then uses the pre-trained model to predict the price of the vehicle. The predicted price is then displayed to the user in a user-friendly format.

The Ford Vehicle Price Predictor project has numerous applications in the automotive industry, including helping customers make informed purchasing decisions, assisting dealerships in pricing their vehicles competitively, and providing a tool for insurance companies to determine the value of vehicles. With its robust machine learning model and user-friendly interface, the Ford Vehicle Price Predictor is an essential tool for anyone involved in the automotive industry üöó

üìñ Additional Description
------------------------
The project code is well-structured and concise, making it easy to understand and modify. The `app.py` file is the main entry point of the application, where the Streamlit app is created and the machine learning model is loaded. The model is loaded using the `joblib` library, which allows for the loading of pre-trained models and other Python objects. The `expected_columns` variable is used to store the expected columns of the input data, which is used to ensure that the input data is in the correct format.

The project also includes a `ford_l_model_3.pkl` file, which contains the pre-trained machine learning model, and a `ford_scaler_3.pkl` file, which contains the scaler used to scale the input data. The `ford_column_3.pkl` file contains the expected columns of the input data, which is used to ensure that the input data is in the correct format. These files are loaded using the `joblib` library and are used to make predictions on new, unseen data.
